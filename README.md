## Why, What, Who
I started to practice working on some skills I wwanted to learn more about
I wanted to practice working with an api as well as practice some basic vanilla javascript and css skills. 
I was modeling it after the [Common Cause ](https://www.commoncause.org/find-your-representative/addr/). 

## TODO:
- Site speed
- Add fixes to comply with Accessibility guidelines
- Browswer compatibility (only works in Chrome right now)
- Redo in React
- Fix the branches - currently just include the minimized files in main
- Add more features such as: 
  - Add fetch for congressional statements
  - Add information for U.S. House of Representative members
  - Combine with Google Civics API - to search address and represenatives 
- Additional items, I have not thought about yet. :)
