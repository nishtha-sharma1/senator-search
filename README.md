# Senator-Search

GitHub Pages Link: [Senator Search](https://nishtha-sharma1.github.io/senator-search/)

## Why, What, Who
I started this to practice working with vanilla javascript as well as working with an API.
This site was modeled after the [Common Cause ](https://www.commoncause.org/find-your-representative/addr/). 

## TODO:
- Site speed
- Add fixes to comply with Accessibility guidelines
- Browswer compatibility (only works in Chrome right now)
- Redo in React
- Fix the branches - currently just include the minimized files in main in order to work with pages
- Add more features such as: 
  - Get congressional statement search working
  - Add information for U.S. House of Representative members
  - Combine with Google Civics API - to search address and represenatives
